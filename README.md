# Deep_Learning_109S
## Homework1
### hw1-1
- Implement basic neural network, including feedfoward and backpropagation
- Only allowed to use numpy, pandas
- Using MedMNIST dataset
- Note
	- Each layer's backprogation gradient formula is the same, except output layer  
### hw1-2
- Implement basic CNN with pytorch
- Note
	- Remember to use tensor.cuda() while feedfoward data to get GPU acceleration 
	- Use tensor.cpu() to do other calculation
